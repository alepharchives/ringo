% 1. Put with replicas works
% 2. Simple syncing works (small items)
% 3. Syncing works (large items)

% motto:
% in the worst case data will be lost. Aim at a good average case and try to
% ensure that it is possible to salvage data by hand after a catastrophic
% failure. 
%
% Losing one data item is annoying. Losing all your data is a catastrophy.
% It makes sense to minimize probability of the latter event.
%
% Don't try to make the worst case (catastrophic failure) disappear. Try to
% minimize its effects instead.

% opportunistic replication:
% 1. replicate, wait for replies
% 2. if no replies are received in Q secods, send the request again with
%    duplicate bit on (ring may have changed / healed during the past Q
%    seconds)
% 3. if the step 2 repeats C times, request fails and data is (possibly) lost



% - Why sync_inbox is needed:
%
% Sync_put is called by a replica after owner has requested an entry,
% that is missing from the owner's DB, from the replica. The missing
% entry isn't added to the DB immediately as we cannot be sure that the
% entry is _really_ missing from the DB: Since put requests are allowed
% any time _during_ the Merkle tree construction, this entry might have
% just missed the previous tree. Hence, the entry goes to a sync buffer
% to wait for the tree to be updated.
%
% If the new updated tree is still missing this entry, we can safely add
% it to the DB and update the new tree accordingly.
%
% - Why sync_outbox is needed:
%
% Collecting entries from the DB is expensive. Outbox is used to buffer
% requests from several replicas so that they can be served with a single 
% scan over the DB file.
%

% what if the domain is closed (don't make the DB read-only)

% What happens with duplicate SyncIDs? -- Collisions should be practically
% impossible when using 64bit SyncIDs (Time + Random). However, a duplicate
% syncid doesn't break anything, it just prevents re-syncing from succeeding.
%
% Note that duplicate SyncIDs doesn't matter per se. They become an issue
% only if an entry with an already existing SyncID wasn't replicated correctly
% and it must be re-synced afterwards. If it's replicated ok, everything's ok.
